# How to build this project

Open a terminal in the yfiles-jupyter-graphs-for-kuzu directory and execute the following command:

```bash
python -m build
```

This creates two files,  
- yfiles_jupyter_graphs_for_kuzu-1.0.0b0.tar.gz and 
- yfiles_jupyter_graphs_for_kuzu-1.0.0b0-py3-none-any.whl

To use the build package install either one of them: 

```bash
pip install dist/yfiles_jupyter_graphs_for_kuzu-1.0.0b0.whl
```

Now you're ready to use this in jupyter lab or jupyter notebook.
